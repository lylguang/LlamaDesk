## 📸 Screenshots

One workbench covers the whole local-AI loop: the icon rail switches apps, the left panel picks a backend and its parameters, and the right side shows the result — every page shares the same layout.

### 📊 Benchmarks

<img src="docs/images/screenshot-benchmark.png" alt="Benchmarks" width="100%"/>

One run sweeps the whole matrix — context length (1K–1M) × concurrency × cache scenario (cold / partial / full hit) — and reports TTFT, TPOT, TPS, aggregate throughput and prefill per rung, with a **cache hit comparison** that turns the cold-versus-hit gap into a multiplier (a ×1 result means the server never hit its cache). Results are stored and can be exported to HTML.

## ✨ Features

### Model Hub

- **Search & browse** — ModelScope model search with repository file listings and detail pages (parameters, size, downloads, license, tags).
- **Full-format downloads** — GGUF (llama.cpp), safetensors (vLLM / SGLang), bin / pt / ckpt / onnx; single file or whole-repo "download all"; HuggingFace as the source for audio.cpp GGUF models.
- **Download manager** — Queue-based concurrent downloads with pause / resume / cancel, resumable transfer (HTTP 206), favorites, and multi-directory storage.
- **Capability categories** — Auto-classified as Chat / TTS / ASR / Image / Other and persisted, surfaced as badges and filters.

### Model Services

- **First-run wizard** — One-click Qwen3.5 4B / 9B / 35B-A3B and Qwen3.6 27B models that download and deploy automatically once selected; also supports a custom HuggingFace GGUF model.
- **Cloud model service** — Presets for 20 mainstream OpenAI-compatible providers (OmniLabs, DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu GLM, Kimi, Doubao, Wenxin, Hunyuan, MiniMax, iFlytek Spark, 01.AI, StepFun, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more), presented as a three-column **providers / configuration / models** panel: keep several provider profiles side by side and activate one with a click — the active profile is written back into the slots the gateway and `omi` CLI already read. Connectivity testing, live model-list fetching, and a **Default Models** page for per-purpose defaults.
- **Unified three-engine runtime** — llama.cpp (default: GGUF from local files or HuggingFace, GPU offload, KV cache quantization, multimodal mmproj), vLLM, and SGLang behind one abstraction with hot switching; or connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint directly (remote mode).
- **Unified gateway** — A single local endpoint that routes each model to the local inference server or a cloud API, speaking Chat Completions / Responses / Anthropic Messages (including bidirectional tool calling); optional API-key auth, interactive OpenAPI docs, and `/v1`, `/health`, `/metrics` endpoints with one-click copy from settings; `/mcp` and `/v1/memories` expose the knowledge base and shared memory to external clients.

### Built-in Apps

Every app shares one workstation layout: a global icon rail on the far left, a configuration panel on the left (engine switch / settings / input / primary action), and a result area on the right.

- **Chat** — streaming responses with reasoning display, image attachments (multimodal), web search (Bing / DuckDuckGo / Tavily with results injected as cited context), and text-file attachments; attach local knowledge bases to a message and answers come back with `[n]` citation traceability; auto-titled conversations, per-app session isolation, usage tracking.
- **Voice** — TTS from multiple sources (audio.cpp local engine, Edge-TTS, OpenAI-compatible TTS) plus a voice clone library, and multi-engine ASR (whisper.cpp / audio.cpp / OpenAI-compatible transcription); live listening conversations (cloud / local) with an embedded record player.
- **Image** — Generation via cloud OpenAI-compatible APIs, ComfyUI, or the local MLX (mflux) engine on Apple Silicon. MLX weights are pre-downloaded with live progress before generation, and the Prompt Plaza's **Try it** drops a prompt straight onto this page.
- **Video** — Three backends behind one submit-then-poll flow: MiniMax (H3, cloud, image-to-video from a first frame), Seedance (Volcano Ark content-generation tasks), and ComfyUI (local workflows); prompt / negative prompt / resolution / duration / seed / aspect ratio / watermark toggle plus first-frame upload, with finished clips kept in a history library you can play, download, or delete.
- **OCR** — Three engines: local Tesseract (one-click install, multilingual LSTM language packs, word/line bounding boxes), PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv6 resident worker, ~140 MB for the medium model), and VLM (Chandra / GLM-OCR / LightOnOCR). Upload PDF / images and get structured Markdown — GFM tables, KaTeX math, code blocks, captions, and bounding-box-cropped image regions — with a document queue and search.
- **Translate** — Switch between the current chat model (local / OpenAI-compatible) and the free Google endpoint across 22 languages, with source auto-detection, language swap, and one-click copy; **Live Translate** opens the microphone for real-time transcription (reusing all three ASR engines) and renders several target languages side by side.
- **Music** — Song, cover and vocal generation over two protocols, StepFun and MiniMax (the local-engine slot is reserved): the asynchronous one submits and polls, the synchronous one runs as a background job and backfills the record, and both land in the same table. The left column is a playlist library, the right side is the selected playlist's tracks, and a persistent player bar sits at the bottom; new songs join the default playlist automatically, album art is derived deterministically per track, and a playlist cover is a 2×2 mosaic of its first four tracks.
- **Prompt Plaza** — Two tabs, **Prompt Plaza** and **My prompts**, over 2,733 bundled prompts (638 image prompts across apps / marketing / posters / illustration / IP / other / art, 2,060 video prompts, 35 LLM prompts), with source filters (Image2Hub / GPT-Image-2 / H3 Cases / MiniMax …) and full-text search; **Copy** takes the text, **Try it** routes to the Image / Video / Chat app with the prompt attached, and **Add to my prompts** imports a plaza entry into your own list (deduplicated by source key) where you can define categories and create / edit / delete entries. The prompt library ships inside the installer and seeds idempotently, and example images download on demand through the system proxy.
- **Mini apps** — Eight one-task sandboxed tools; each card on the home wall names the capability it needs and offers **Configure** when something is missing: **Background remover** (local ONNX engine, nothing uploaded, ~1s, recolor plus erase/restore brushing), **ID photo** (local portrait cutout resized to 20 specs — 1-inch, 2-inch, visa and more — with background swap and A4 print sheets), **Mosaic** (paint-to-redact with batch export, entirely on-device), **Portrait** (style presets for professional headshots and character avatars), **Meeting notes** (import or record audio → transcribe → agenda / conclusions / action items), **Copywriter** (multiple titles, selling points or scripts by purpose and tone), **Notes** (calendar and tag views, image attachments, bodies stored in the local database, optionally exposed to the agent read-only), and **Animated stickers** (one photo becomes a 16-piece still pack in a single art style, then a tap turns any piece into a looping GIF; the image model is picked inside the page — cloud models use the photo as reference, local engines draw from a description). Each mini app is one self-contained HTML page running in a sandboxed iframe **without** `allow-same-origin`, and the host grants capabilities one by one.
- **Knowledge Base (local RAG)** — Ingest local files (text read directly; PDF / images go through VLM OCR), handwritten notes, and web pages; Markdown-aware chunking (heading sections + greedy paragraph packing + overlapping hard splits) with optional embeddings (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`), hybrid recall that fuses BM25 and cosine-vector rankings with RRF, and optional reranking (Jina / SiliconFlow / Cohere-compatible `/v1/rerank`); four tabs for recall testing, documents, access, and settings; no external vector store or FTS extension required.
- **Memory** — Long-term memory shared by every agent: built-in `memory_search` / `memory_save` / `memory_list` tools let agents store facts, preferences, and experience, and pinned or frequently used entries are injected into the system prompt; the same SQLite store is readable and writable through the gateway REST `/v1/memories`, MCP tools, and the `omi memory` CLI. The page shows totals, pinned / agent-written / updated-in-7-days / retrieval hit rate / merged writes / archived / blocked-sensitive counts, and carries two switches — **Enable memory** and **Confirm before writing** (the latter sends agent / CLI / MCP writes to a pending queue first).
- **Skills Manager** — One central skills repository (default `~/.agents/skills`) managed and synced into every coding tool, with 53 built-in tool adapters and symlink / copy sync modes; six sections: market (skillssh leaderboard), my skills, presets, projects, tools, and backup (Git remote, snapshots, auto-backup).

### Agents & Protocols

- **Pi Agent modes** — Agent / Plan (read-only tools, plan before acting) / Goal; the toolset is built-in file, shell, and search tools plus memory tools and tools from enabled MCP servers, and Plan mode automatically excludes tools with side effects.
- **MCP client** — Manage MCP servers from the settings **Tools** group over stdio, Streamable HTTP, or legacy SSE, with connectivity testing, tool enumeration, and JSON import; their tools are injected into the agent as `mcp_*`, and servers that fail to connect are skipped.
- **MCP server** — The local gateway exposes `POST /mcp` (stateless Streamable HTTP) so any MCP client — Claude Code, Cursor, and friends — can use the knowledge base (`kb_search` / `kb_list`) and memory (`memory_search` / `memory_save` / `memory_list`) as tools; opening `GET /mcp` in a browser gives you a built-in playground (connect → list tools → forms generated from each schema → call → raw JSON-RPC).
- **Three memory channels** — Built-in agent tools, the gateway REST / MCP endpoints, and the `omi memory` CLI all read and write the same SQLite store; `omi launch` refreshes the managed memory block in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md and mounts an `omni-memory` MCP server for Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode.

### Ops & Telemetry

- **Live dashboard** — Prefill / generation tokens and speed (tok/s), request counts, active models, memory and CPU load, uptime, and model disk usage (free / total of the volume holding the data directory) — polled every 2s.
- **Benchmarks** — Context-length (1K–1M) × concurrency × cache-scenario (cold / partial / full hit) sweeps reporting TTFT, TPOT, TPS, aggregate throughput and prefill per rung, plus a **cache hit comparison** that turns the cold-versus-hit gap into a multiplier (llama.cpp additionally reports how much of the prompt the server reused, so a ×1 result points straight at a server that never hit its cache). Runs against local or remote servers, stores every result, exports to HTML, and `omi benchmark --contexts 32k --cache cold,warm` drives the same matrix from the CLI.
- **Server logs** — Live tail with ANSI colors, auto-scroll, truncation guard, copy / clear.
- **CLI integrations** — One-click launch commands for Claude Code (local / cloud, Opus–Sonnet–Haiku mapping), Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, Pi, and Copilot CLI, each bound to a default model and wired into shared memory.
- **Updates & i18n** — Stable / beta channels with in-app updates, automatic or manual update checks (the About page reports the latest release and links to the download), light / dark / follow-system themes, **a customizable left primary menu** (Settings → Appearance: drag to reorder, show or hide each entry — the order there is the order of the menu), a setup wizard, zh / en UI language, SQLite-backed session stores.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Requirements**

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+
- macOS (Apple Silicon); Linux / Windows support planned

```bash
bun install

# development with HMR (recommended)
cd apps/studio && bun run dev:hmr

# development without HMR
cd apps/studio && bun run dev

# build for production
cd apps/studio && bun run build:dev
```

## 💻 omi CLI

`omi` is a global command-line tool wrapping the backend: start the app, manage inference servers, configure cloud providers, pick models, launch coding tools, and read/write shared memory — **sharing the same database as the desktop app** (models, settings, and memory stay in sync).

```bash
cd apps/studio && bun link    # install the global omi command (~/.bun/bin)
omi help                       # list all commands
omi help <command> [sub]       # help for one command (e.g. omi help memory add)
omi guide                      # full manual: install, start, models, memory, coding tools

omi start --server             # start the app and bring up the inference server
omi model --select             # pick the active model in the terminal (--list only lists)
omi models                     # local + cloud model inventory; omi model-info <name> for detail
omi serve --port 8090          # run the inference server headless (foreground, CTRL+C to exit)
omi launch codex --model qwen3-4b-q4_k_m  # launch a coding tool on the current model (memory attached)
omi memory add "prefers pnpm"  # write to shared memory (same store the agents use)
omi memory search build-tools  # search memory
omi memory mcp                 # run as a stdio MCP server so coding tools share the same memory
omi server logs                # server log tail; omi install checks engine dependencies
omi status
```

How it works: the main process listens on a Unix socket in the data directory (`omni-control.sock`, mode 0600); `omi` uses that channel to focus the window, navigate, start/stop servers, and read/write settings. When the app is not running, `models` / `model-info` / `cloud` / `memory` fall back to reading the same SQLite database directly.

Docs: the full manual is [docs/omi-cli.md](./docs/omi-cli.md) (generated by `omi guide --md`, same source as Settings → Tools → Command line in the app); the legacy `omni` command (`chat` / `doctor` / `config` …) lives in [docs/omni-cli.md](./docs/omni-cli.md).

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

LlamaDesk is built on [OmniStudio](https://gitee.com/jwangkun/OmniStudio), an open-source project by Kunpeng Talk (jwangkun) — also on GitHub as [kunpengtalk/OmniStudio](https://github.com/kunpengtalk/OmniStudio). Heartfelt thanks to the original author; most of the core capabilities in this project come from upstream.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### Windows: the window opens but the content area is blank

**Symptom**: title bar and menu are there, the content area is one flat colour; the process is alive and the backend is healthy (`http://127.0.0.1:10000/health` responds).

**Cause**: WebView2's **GPU process keeps crashing**. Once Chromium gives up on the GPU it stops producing compositor frames — the page DOM is fully rendered, it just never gets painted ("a page, but no picture"). It is not a frontend or packaging problem, so an even cleaner payload will not help.

**Confirm** (optional): search `%LOCALAPPDATA%\omni-studio.kunpengtalk.com\<channel>\WebView2\Partitions\default\EBWebView\chrome_debug.log` for:

```
GPU process exited unexpectedly
GPU process isn't usable. Goodbye.
```

**Workaround**: force an in-process GPU by setting the env var before launching.

```powershell
# current session only, then launch OmniStudio from that terminal
$env:WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS = "--in-process-gpu"
```

```bat
:: or persist it (then launch from the Start menu as usual)
setx WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS "--in-process-gpu"
```

This flag only helps the GPU-crash flavour of a blank window. If the blank page comes from something else (e.g. a frontend module error) it will not help — for that, check the renderer console instead. Once the GPU driver or WebView2 is updated you can drop the variable and return to the default rendering path.
